This code works, but obviously you'll need to substitute valid
credentials for it to do so.

Not counting some struggles I had with installation, the original challenge
took me about 45-50 minutes to complete. After figuring out syntax,
the bulk of my time was spent figuring out how to select the email 
I want - primarily because I had some trouble selecting the appropriate
table without any reliable classes or IDs.

All told, the entire thing took about 2 hours. Again, it was slower 
than I'd have liked, largely due to a lack of reliable
CSS selectors - tabbing through the compose section seems much more reliable
to me, but it took a bit for me to arrive there. The selector I used for the
compose button isn't something I'm terribly happy about, but it was the
most reliable method I could figure out.
